# Snakes_and_Ladders_Java


This project simulates the Snake and Ladders game using a command-line interface. Players roll a die and move on the board, encountering snakes that send them back and ladders that propel them forward. The game runs automatically, displaying the results of each die roll and the players' positions until one player reaches the final square.
